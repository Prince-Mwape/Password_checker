# Password_checker
This is a python program that checks the strength of an entered password. It achieves this by checking against a set of standards such as length, if the password has Uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, as well as special characters.

To run this program, simply download and then import it into the IDE of your choosing and run in the terminal
For version 1.0 it will run like this till I figure out how to give it a GUI.
Thank you so much for downloading
